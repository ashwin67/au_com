There is a sense of relaxation in the air, just like the slow metros and trams that traverse the cities.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/porto_boats.jpg" alt="Boats at Porto" title="The Explorers and their boats" /> Once these boats would have sailed the world’s seas and brought riches to the people here.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/sao_bento.jpg" alt="Sao Bento Train Station" title="A Rich Train Station" /> The Frescoes here tell the story of how rich they once must have been.</p> <p>Lisbon is a bigger city with a lot more tourist attractions; The iconic yellow tram, the pretty neighborhoods and the view of the city itself.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/portugal.jpg" alt="Tram" title="The Icon" /> A lot of people cram inside the trams. And an equal number pose in front of them for photos.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/lisbon.jpg" alt="Lisbon" /> The Santa Justa from where we took this picture was built by one of Eiffel’s (the tower guy) students and is a big attraction.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/baixa_se_chiado.jpg" alt="Neighborhood" title="Maybe Baixa or Se or Chiado" /> Walking along these neighborhoods is one the best parts of traveling in Lisbon.</p> <p>This was one of the largest and longest lived empires in history which we have learned so much in school. Bartolomeu Diaz and Vasco Da Gama are names known to everyone. I learned that the empire truly ended only in 1999! I am not an admirer of empire but I am surely an admirer of history and sustaining a global empire for 6 centuries truly is something. The country is so small but its language is spoken by a quarter billion people across the world! The original explorers surely wouldn’t have thought about their impacts when they started all of it. And then history just happened.</p> <p><img src="/assets/portugal/explorers.jpg" alt="Explorers" title="The ship" /></p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/Blogging-from-phone-git-nano/">&laquo; Blogging from my phone with Git and Nano</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/Beautiful-Austria/">Beautiful Austria &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/thumbnails/porto_sign.jpg" alt="Ola Portugal"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/car_charging/">Electric car charging</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;17 Jul 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/social_media_and_the_erosion_of_truth/">Social media and the erosion of truth</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;26 Aug 2020</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/news/">News</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Jun 2020</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
