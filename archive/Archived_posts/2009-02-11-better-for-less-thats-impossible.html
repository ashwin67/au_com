<p>If a product is the costliest, then it ought to be the best. That is the line of thought most people have!! A few days back, I saw a bottle of mineral water whose price was Rs.40 as compared to other brands which cost Rs.12. It beats me as to why any one would spend that much! It is after all water. Yet, I see people buy the special water. Similar examples can be seen elsewhere too. An apple with a half inch wide sticker pasted on it is 4 times as costly as the one without the sticker. I've never found a really noticeableÂ  taste difference between the two.</p><!--more-->
<p>A few days back I bought this laptop called <a href="http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=1&amp;model=2303&amp;l1=24&amp;l2=164&amp;l3=0&amp;l4=0" target="_blank">Asus eeePC 1000h</a>. It provides more than twice the battery backup as conventional laptops, is less than half the weight as conventional laptops, has the same RAM, hard disk and peripherals as conventional ones, has a CPU that runs all my 3D design applications without a hitch AND <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is less than half the price of conventional laptops</span>. The minute I say this last thing, no one is ready to believe me. They think SOMETHING must be wrong with this laptop.</p>
<p>Just keeping a low price tag does not always work. It may actually work against the product.</p>
