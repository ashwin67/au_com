If you had written down the names of each of those present in that event, and 10 years later calculated the total of the net worth of those people, it would be a billion dollars at the least (If not more). And if you calculate the jobs created by them, it would be a few thousands at the least. And I am definitely not exaggerating. Entrepreneurs, Venture capitalists and angel investors were all together, in one place. And also, we won the <a href="http://enlen.in/blog/2009/08/enlen-is-2nd-at-genesis/" target="_blank">2nd prize at Genesis, a venture validation platform</a> from among 6 finalists selected from 100+ companies.</p><!--more--> <p><a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Rashmi Bansal</a> of <a href="http://www.stayhungrybook.com/" target="_blank">stay hungry, stay foolish</a> was one of the star attractions at the event. In her own words, she did a mini session of the book by conducting a panel discussion with 4 other entrepreneurs.</p> <p><a href="http://www.tutorvista.co.in/management.php" target="_blank">Krishan Ganesh</a> (TutorVista) had a lot of clever lines to say: <em>"You have to be stupid to be an entrepreneur. Unfortunately, IIMs hire only the clever ones"</em>; and <em>"Businesses are like bulbs and aircrafts. Accidents happen mostly during the startup phase"</em>; and <em>"Behind every successful entrepreneur is a devoted wife and a surprised mother in law".</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.jumpstartup.net/ourpeople.html" target="_blank">Sanjay Anandram</a> (Jumpstartup Ventures) shared his memories about how he started his first venture out of his dining table and how he named his first company NETA (Net-A in English and neta meaning leader in Hindi). What a motivational speaker he is! He talked about how positive thinking and creative destruction can change the world.</p> <p><a href="http://www.careerlauncher.com/presskit/management_profile.html" target="_blank">Satyanarayanan</a> (Career launcher) told us why he joined IIMB. <em>"I was just playing cricket all the time. Someone told me, it would be difficult to get a job and getting into an IIM was the best way to get a job. So, I wrote CAT". </em>And at IIMB, according to him, he was 11th in grade rankings, from backwards.</p> <p><a href="http://www.biocon.com/biocon_aboutus_kmprofile.asp" target="_blank">Kiran Mazumdar Shaw</a> (Biocon) was the other star attraction who gave the keynote address. She gave a glimpse of the situation that existed during the time she started Biocon, how she didn't take a salary for the first 3 years and how she raised money from banks! In her words, <em>"If I, as a woman can do it, anybody can".</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.idgvcindia.com/team.htm" target="_blank">Sudhir Sethi</a> (IDG Ventures), <a href="http://www.inventuscap.com/samir.html" target="_blank">Samir Kumar</a> (Inventus capital) and <a href="http://www.sportzvillage.com/sportz4kids/who.html" target="_blank">Saumil Majmudar </a>(SportzVillage) were another three who kept the audience mesmerized. Like the Intel ad says "Our heroes are different", these  were the heroes of the entrepreneur community.</p> <p>As Sanjay Anandram said,  <em>"entrepreneurs are not some special type of people. They are just a statistical fact. Of every society, 1-2% of the population will be entrepreneurs. If you happen to be one, great. Otherwise too, great!"</em> However, if you have that itch, to disrupt the status quo, creatively destroy existing institutions, if you have an entrepreneurial mindset, then Eximius was a great place to be.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/webjeda-logo-big.jpg" alt="webjeda"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
