The best way to do this is to register for at least a couple of marathons / 10K runs. Compared to a few years ago, most cities now host these <a href="http://calendar.youtoocanrun.com/" target="_blank">events many times a year</a>. Sometimes, you need that extra motivation so that you don't go on vacations (from running). I participated in two 10K runs and three half-marathons. That made me run 602 Kms this year. It seems so less now! And yes, tracking your workouts are important so that you compete against yourself. A good app like <a href="https://www.endomondo.com" target="_blank">Endomondo</a> helps. And the most important rule I have set; do not set a time for working out, rather set the minimum number of workouts for a week. My number is 4 per week (minimum).</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">Discipline is hard. Like getting up at <a href="http://www.robinsharma.com/blog/06/be-wise-early-rise/" target="_blank">5 AM in the morning</a>.  Like trying to have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/does-global-warming-make-me-look-fat/383509/" target="_blank">cold shower all through the year</a>. Like trying to write a blog post at least once in a week. Like trying to cycle to work all year. Discipline will be top priority for the next year.</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">Change is required. Every once in a few years, you get used to your job so much that eventually, a feeling of stagnation creeps in. You want to change the situation. But every day, you say you'll do it tomorrow. You have so many reasons, that you're not prepared enough for interviews, that may be things will improve at your current job, that you have a big event at home coming soon etc. Now I've finally learned that you should just take the leap and forget about everything else. One day, I just drove my car and attended a walk-in interview with no intention of even joining that company. That brought me out of my slumber and has put me in a better situation today.</li> <li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html" target="_blank">Not being mean is necessary</a>, not just useful. A lot of times, the meanness of others entices you to reply with meanness. And almost always, the negativeness that comes out is detrimental to oneself. OK, enough philosophy. Lets just say that "not being mean is necessary".</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma phaleshu kada chana<br /> Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhurmatey Sangostva Akarmani<br /> The famous verse from the Bhagavat Gita is a great guiding principle. It says one to do his duty and not think of the reward. This year was tough for me during various times. The above guideline kept me going during those times. (And allowed me to remain an atheist. I saw so many people resort to God during those times. Good that God gives strength to them.).</li> </ol> <p style="text-align: justify;">I feel good to know that life can be re-purposed into a constantly improving experiment rather than just a purpose-less decay. I had to say that because I turned 30 this year and am compulsorily supposed to get those thoughts.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">2015 should be made better. Happy new year.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/webjeda-logo-big.jpg" alt="webjeda"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
