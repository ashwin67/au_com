<p style="text-align: justify;">We were talking with the chief of a company about our business idea and project and how he could sell his product to us but it turned out he was interested in investing in the project too. Another day, another chief, similar proposal and this person provided us the contact of a person who does similar work like us in a different country which is a great insight for us. Yet another day, another chief and this person tells us about many other places where we could implement similar projects.</p><!--more-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many such instances dot our day. We look out for a customer and we find an investor. We look out for a seller and find a good business contact. We look out for a consultant and find a great businessman. It is not luck. It is not just the probabilities. It is because we search for something which is not there yet. We look out for something which we want to create just out of an idea. And we believe that it is possible. When you start believing in an idea, when you stop thinking about why something may not work and instead start working on making it possible, everything starts to fall in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had heard the above words a thousand times before I took the entrepreneurship path. Now I am experiencing it. And I think it is a very logical thing to happen. When we believe in an idea and talk about it, people try to build a conversation which usually centers around that idea. Talk movies with someone and she would talk more about movies, actresses and probably new movie ideas. Talk music and she would talk of more music and musicians. Then why not talk about the idea that you believe? Believe and the things just start to work.</p>
