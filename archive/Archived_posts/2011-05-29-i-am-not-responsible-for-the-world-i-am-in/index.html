It does not mean that I would put an atom bomb or something on a city. It just means that I don't have to feel guilty for not sacrificing my life for the good of others in this world.</p><!--more--> <p>I once believed that working for 'someone else (like a large company)' was not good for me. I would often ask 'What am I doing with my life wasting all my energy for the sake of another company?'. I'd think 'Couldn't I do something useful and improve this world rather than just doing work which someone else tells me to do?'. Then, I tried to live my dreams, started a company with friends and did some things I believed were good for this world.</p> <p>The challenges in doing good are immensely large and I have already written a lot about this in those entrepreneurial days. It was not easy. Realism overcame my idealism. I stopped, reset myself and went back to where I was working before.</p> <p>I felt guilty for a long time for quitting something which I thought was the only right thing. But this served as a lesson and now I have realized. There is only one thing which I have control on. It is, the work I do and I will do it well. I do not have any control on its result.</p> <p>If the world is doomed for disaster because of humans' utter disregard for its environment, so be it. I will plant a few trees though, every year, not to prevent the earth from doom but just because I feel it is right to do so.</p> <p>If my country is sinking in corruption, then so be it. I will still not pay any bribes though, not to uplift my country but just because it would hurt my conscience.</p> <p>And with this realization of reality, I now love my work as well. All I now have to think is whether I am enjoying the work I do and the answer is 'Yes'. Since I have no need to think about the usefulness of my work to this world, I am relieved of a great burden.</p> <p>In the end,</p> <blockquote><p>The words are not good for the secret meaning, everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly.... what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another person.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: right;">- <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500" target="_blank">Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha</a></p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/webjeda-logo-big.jpg" alt="webjeda"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
