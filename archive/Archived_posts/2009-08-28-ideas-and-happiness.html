<p>Why do I like writing? Because the writing process forces me to generate new ideas, refine those ideas and put those ideas in understandable format.</p><!--more-->
<p>Why do I like networking with people? Because I can discuss ideas, obtain feedback on those ideas and convert at least some of those ideas into action.</p>
<p>Why do I love teaching at schools? Because school kids ask questions which have a totally different and special perspective which fuels my creativity further.</p>
<p>Why do I love working at our company? It is a <a href="http://sivers.org/laboratory" target="_blank">huge laboratory</a> where we test so many ideas and get the best possible feedback on those ideas.</p>
<p>Do you get bored sometimes? If yes, I think you should start working on an idea.</p>
<p>“If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert.” - Australian psychiatrist W. Béran Wolfe</p>
