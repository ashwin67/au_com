<p>One of my entrepreneur friends, Vinay once told me "Earlier, your boss used to screw you. Now when you are an entrepreneur, the whole world wants to screw you."</p><!--more-->
<p>The customer wants to buy at a cheaper price than you can manufacture. The government wants to stack all its policies against you. The investor wants all the returns in the world. So what do you do?</p>
<p>Right now, all I know is to just stay on course and see through the journey.</p>
