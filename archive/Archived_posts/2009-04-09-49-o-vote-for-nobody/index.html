My country has definitely changed a lot for sure. At least it is not like the pre-1990s when you had to ask permission from the government to set up a company. Democracy has also pretty much worked in this country. Although it got a rating of <a href="http://a330.g.akamai.net/7/330/25828/20081021195552/graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy%20Index%202008.pdf" target="_blank">7.8 out of 10 according to EIU</a> and is considered a flawed democracy, it is still the 35th best democracy in the world. Although it still is divided on the lines of caste, religion and other affiliations, it somehow manages to hold itself together. Yet, in this largest functioning democracy, elections bring a mood of gloom, hatred and disillusionment rather than a mood of celebration. Probably, the choice of candidates available to the elector is the reason for this unpleasant mood. If that is the case, take heart. You can still embrace democracy and yet not kill your soul by voting for a wrong candidate.</p> <p><a href="http://eci.nic.in/ElectoralLaws/HandBooks/MANUAL_OF_LAW_VOL_II.pdf" target="_blank">49-O is a rule</a> which can be used as a civil rights tool. The rule states:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Elector deciding not to vote</strong> — If an elector, after his electoral roll number has been duly entered in the register of voters in Form 17A and has put his signature or thumb impression thereon as required under sub-rule (1) of rule 49L, decided not to record his vote, a remark to this effect shall be made against the said entry in Form 17A by the presiding officer and the signature or thumb impression of the elector shall be obtained against such remark.</p></blockquote> <p>The rule doesn't go any further than being just a civil rights tool. It will only mean that you have not opted to vote for anybody and is nothing more than that (There are hoax mails circulating which claim more than this and are all false). However, there is one way of making this rule a really powerful tool. By default, the number of people who exercise 49-O are not disclosed by the election commission. Yet, using the <a href="http://righttoinformation.gov.in/" target="_blank">right to information act</a>, you can obtain the information and publicize the issue. As a result, this can be a demonstration that you have performed your duty and yet do not subscribe to the country's laws fully. Say for example, one thousand people in a constituency of one lakh decide not to vote. That is 1% of that constituency's votes. The information if made public is pretty good news for the papers and tv channels. That is a start.</p> <p>In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, "the function of a civil resistance is to provoke response. To continue to provoke until they respond or they change the law". In this case, until we have a system where unfit, undeserving or criminal candidates cannot contest the elections.</p> <p>There are some who don't believe in the power of their vote. Yes, you alone can't change everything. All you can really do is to be true to yourself with the help of that one vote. Truth will take care of everything else.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/webjeda-logo-big.jpg" alt="webjeda"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
