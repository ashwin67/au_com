<p>Till a few days back, I was trying to analyze what might have gone wrong. Here I was, everything in perfect state, with one of the best jobs for my education level, with the perfect status level in society, with a pay that satisfied everything I wanted, without a single manager who could make me work against my will, with a house that was leaping distance from the office, without any pollution problems to crib about and far from the usual headaches of Bangalore. </p><!--more-->
<p>When I quit my job, some praised me, many scolded me. Some thought I was a genius. Many thought I was a fool. Some showed hope, others talked of despair. </p>
<p>And now, the world is just silent. The field is extremely large. The crowd is distant and I can't hear them. The clock is ticking away fast. Resources are running low. And the goal-post is only visible as a tiny speck tens of miles away.</p>
