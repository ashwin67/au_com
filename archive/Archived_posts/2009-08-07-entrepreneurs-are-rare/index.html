To create tasks for oneself is even more difficult. That is why, we have people to assign us tasks in large companies. You get your tasks from your manager, the manager gets his tasks from his manager and the chain continues till the top. It does not end even there. The people at the top are answerable to the board, the shareholders and so on who indirectly set their tasks.</p><!--more--> <p>It is pretty obvious that a majority of the world's population does a task assigned to it by someone else. The majority do not want to be in a situation where they have to decide what to do next. The majority want someone else to tell them "You are supposed to do 'x', 'y' tasks in 'z' days and you will be guaranteed a secure life.</p> <p>However, we do not like to accept this simple fact and instead find a thousand reasons for behaving this way. "I have commitments" is the most common reason. I used to believe in that reason until recently. However, now I feel it is the fear of 'not knowing to create tasks' that makes us want to work for others. Here are 2 strong reasons to believe this:</p> <ol> <li>When you are the task-creator, the probability of having a secure life is just 50% (or may be even less than that). However, when you work for others, the probability of a secure life is most often 100%.</li> <li>Evolutionarily, humans have been hunters and then farmers. In both cases, the exact work to be done so that one can survive has been taught from father to son, mother to daughter. We have always followed instructions from others. The psychology that seems to have been hardwired in our brains is: "Follow this routine and you are safe".</li> </ol> <p>And that is why, I think entrepreneurs are so rare. You have to break the routine, you have to forego security, you have to work against the hardwired psychology.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/webjeda-logo-big.jpg" alt="webjeda"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
