<p>So many days have passed before I came back to livejournal to write. In fact, I was not away from blogging. I was just blogging <a href="http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/">officially</a>.<br /> 
So much has passed in the last few days. We formally <a href="http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/2008/04/after-work.html">opened shop</a>. Our website <a href="http://www.sapgreen.com">sapgreen.com</a> is now up and running. We got featured in a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/06/stories/2008040650910200.htm">few papers</a>. Best of all, <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Apr52008/state2008040561141.asp">Deccan Herald</a> had an interesting caption. My cellphone doesn't last more that 12-14 hrs per battery charge these days. Finally, <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?leftnm=3&amp;autono=319553">business standard</a> also had something to say about us.<br />
Apart from all of these, the real stuff is that trees planted through sapgreen.com is now <b>106</b>. And this is what matters to me.</p>
