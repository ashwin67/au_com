<p>It has been 3 weeks since I last blogged. The first 2 or 3 days it didn't feel anything. The next 5 to 6 days, it was like "tonight, I will write" and it somehow never happened. And after the first 10 days had passed, there was sort of a pressure that I had to write something really super to make up for all the absence. But anything I could think of was not good enough for me.</p><!--more-->
<p>However, the entrepreneurial spirit inside me kicked in today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”  (Nolan Bushnell)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no point in saying, "I'll do it" a hundred times. All that matters is whether you really do it or not.</p>
