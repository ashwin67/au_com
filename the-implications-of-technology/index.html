The easily predictable ones for example are: Loss of low skill jobs - Robots and Artificial Intelligence together threaten to wipe out most of these jobs. Countries are already considering universal basic income to combat such a scenario. Inequality - This is already on the rise during the past few decades and is only set to rise. Correlation may not imply causation always, but it is quite possible that the inequality results in a revolution or two!
