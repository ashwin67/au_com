<p>I've tried livejournal. Then, I also wrote at blogger. However, nothing impressed me as much as Wordpress. I'm not talking of wordpress.com which also is a typographically beautiful blogging site. What really blew my mind was the open source blogging tool that is <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Wordpress provides software which you could use to host your own blogging site. All you need to do is purchase a domain, get a hosting service and then host your blog at that server making use of the blogging tools provided by wordpress. Now, who would anyone want to do that when blogger, wordpress.com etc provide a blogging platform for free? Here is a small list of people or organizations who use wordpress to host their blogs: <a href="http://gretawire.foxnews.com/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, <a href="http://www.time.com/" target="_blank">Time</a>, <a href="http://www.andyroddick.com/" target="_blank">Andy Roddick</a>, <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>, and the list goes on. Full list at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/Famous_Blogs" target="_blank">Famous wordpress blogs</a>. If you opened even one of those blogs, you would notice the difference instantaneously. They are heavily customized according to the needs of the author. In fact, wordpress is not just a blogging software now and it is quite on its way to replace CMS software such as <a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a>. This according to me is one of the biggest reasons for having a separate domain and blogging tools. And when it comes to blogging tools, wordpress wins outright.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Installation takes less than 10 minutes. Customization depends on you. However writing a great blog takes more effort than just installing a tool. That's something to be learnt for a long time and a tool after all can just act as a great medium.</p>
