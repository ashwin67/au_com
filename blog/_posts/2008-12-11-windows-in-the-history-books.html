<p>Is it possible that some day, there will no more be microsoft windows? Could your operating system be free? Hard to imagine that way, but I bet it will be so in less than 10 years. In 1959, a US postmaster general Arthur Summerfield remarked: "We stand on the threshold of rocket mail". Then there was email. 7-8 years back, could anyone imagine that mail could be free and unlimited? All you had was a 4MB limited email exceeding which you needed to pay for further usage. Then came skype and voice transmission became free. Youtube brought unlimited videos. The ultimate result of all these is that, "UNLIMITED" and "FREE" are no more a novelty. We expect everything on the internet to be so.</p>
<p>Open source was always there, and people say it made its impact felt a few years back itself when many many servers started using linux instead of windows. Even google's servers run on open source. Then there is the mozilla firefox project which caused great pain to internet explorer. Wordpress, Joomla, drupal and many others in a joint effort put many web design companies out of business. Wikipedia made encyclopedias redundant. Even google wouldn't have flourished if it was a closed entity.</p>
<p>Ask a firefox user why she likes it. Top in the "best things" list would be the ability to extend firefox to one's own needs. Something totally out of question in internet explorer. Same thing holds good for linux. Extend it the way you want. Not at all possible with windows. And if you have a problem with the software, there are millions of community users to help you out. Linux is not without its problems, but for sure, it proves one thing. The future will be 'free'.</p>
