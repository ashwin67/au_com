<p>I am waiting for my friend, Anil to write a post on the experiences he had at Sringeri.</p>
<p>A company I really admired from a long time, one which was admired by many others too, a winner of social responsibility awards multiple times, one which seemed to change people's lives. The same company makes money in reprehensible ways, takes advantage of the ignorance of illiterates, pushes its products on people who didn't even know they required the product. Wow!!</p>
<p>Naxalites are always shown in bad light on the TV. However, it seems to me, at least the environment has benefitted from them. Illegal mining supposedly has completely come to a halt in the area.</p>
<p>I'm not sure who is right, who is wrong anymore. Everything is just perception.</p>
