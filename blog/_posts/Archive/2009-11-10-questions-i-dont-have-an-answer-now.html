<p>I am writing this post so that I can come back 5 years later and see if I have found the answers. Its just a list of questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there really something called a breakthrough event in business or is it just a series of incremental improvements?</li>
<li>Does a startup become successful only if we keep fighting against all odds? Or, is it better to stop the battle, prepare with better arms and then come back? <span>I remember the quote by </span><span>Abraham Lincoln</span><span>: "</span><span>Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe</span><span>". The catch however is that, in the case of a startup, you don't even know what to chop until you have started. </span></li>
<li>How much of a toll does starting your own company take on your family?</li>
<li>Once you start a company, you start to live in a different world. You start being more optimistic about things. You start living on hope. A hope that, even if something fails, that will lead to something even better. Does this feeling exist only during the startup phase? Or does it the change you forever?</li>
</ol>
