<p>&nbsp;A new lesson I learned is "reality has to be experienced unlike thoughts and ideas". Following list is an echo of this statement where each thought gets re-estimated during the real action.</p><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Before startup thought: We will build a website.</li>
<li>After starting reality: php bugs, mysql database problems, web-host support tickets, 100s of images to find, layout designs, color combinations mismatch, payment gateway integration,......</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before startup thought: We will register a company.</li>
<li>After starting reality: Auditor fees, Name approval problems, government apathy, delays in registration,......</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before startup thought: We will meet corporates, government officials etc...</li>
<li>After starting reality: Corporate contacts hard to find, government officials come to office at 11AM and leave before 3PM and best of all, it starts raining on a day you have a meeting with someone and you don't have a car...</li>
</ul>
<p>Many more such realities hit you in the face. Some more interesting realities are power cuts for 50% of the day on some days.<br />
The entrepreneurial mindset is to not bother with these issues and somehow manage to overcome them. None of these should ever matter in the long-term. In the short-term though, they always create some level of delays and frustration. More than all, these issues tend to disrupt the focus of an entrepreneur's mind.</p>
<p>One and a half months after quitting software, I once again had the opportunity to look at some html and css. Although not much logic is involved in these scripts, it still fits into the software realm. Fortunately, the more intensive work is being done by the other co-founder of my company. :-)</p>
