<p>"What is the opposite of happiness?  Sadness?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness.&nbsp; Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this.&nbsp; The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is - here's the clincher - boredom."<br />
-Timothy Ferris, <i> Four-Hour Workweek</i> </p>
