<p>Watching LOST sometimes gives strange insights. Especially the dialogues said by the lead characters.<br />
Desmond: "The universe has a way of.... sort of.... course correcting itself"<br />
John Locke: "Everything that happens here.... happens for a reason"<br />
John Locke: " Do not tell me what I cannot do"</p>
<p>And as it happens in LOST, sometimes various parts of life's jigsaw puzzle fall beautifully into one single piece. And what am I talking about? Its as mysterious as LOST&nbsp; :-)</p>
