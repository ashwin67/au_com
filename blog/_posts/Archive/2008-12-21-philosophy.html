<p>Everyone's got a philosphy of their own. Don't they. I've got mine <a href="http://www.ashwinupadhyaya.com/about" target="_blank">here</a>. I am not sure who would benefit most by reading another person's thoughts. The writer by giving his thought a form. Or whether its the reader by collecting hundreds of such thoughts.</p>
