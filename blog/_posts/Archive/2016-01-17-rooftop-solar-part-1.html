<p>After quitting the renewable energy I had founded several years back, I had not looked at the sector until recently. The sector seems to have come a long way from where it was when I was running my company.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Solar_panels_on_a_roof.jpg" alt="RoofTop Solar" /></p><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>I found that the company where I am working at now has 500KW of solar panels installed on its terrace and the cost of solar power is cheaper than the state electricity board's price.</li>
<li>Investment for a solar project need not borne by the company that wants to draw the electricity. Instead there are project developers who work on a power purchase model.</li>
<li>Several subsidies are available for such projects and availing these seems to be a streamlined process in the recent times.</li>
<li>A friend of mine wanted to install a rooftop project and I did some calculations for him. In the process, I thought of making a calculator here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is that calculator that gives a rough estimate. <del>I will be improving this calculator and also writing more on this subject as my research progresses.</del></p>
