<p>Being on the other side of the table while conducting an interview teaches you so much about "how to face an interview". When I look back now, I've conducted varied types of interviews, from posts for marketing managers to software engineers. Low salary jobs to high salary jobs. 15 year experience people to no experience people. I don't claim that I have understood everything about this process. Yet, I think there is a basic criteria based on which you get that job or you don't get it. It's called confidence.</p><!--more-->
<p>From the employer's perspective, he has a job to be worked on. All he needs is a person who can say one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li> "Yes, I can do this job because I have worked on such a thing before and I know every single aspect of this job". Advantage: Experience.</li>
<li>"Yes, I can do this job because I am extremely strong technically and can prove by solving any problem in a given time". Advantage: Technically sound.</li>
<li>"Yes, I can do this job because I have learnt 10 languages in 3 years and have an example project for each". Advantage: Fast learner.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everybody has some sort of advantage and it is for you to find out what you have. When you have one, just show it off in such a way that the person on the other side of the table is overwhelmed with your confidence level. In fact, we have seen some people who have the skill to fake confidence and succeeded to a certain level!! Anyway, that's a matter whichÂ  is of concern for the interviewer, not the interviewee.</p>
