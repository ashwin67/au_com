<p style="text-align: justify;">Mysore Santhe started on January 10th, 2010 as an informal gathering of people who do not necessarily have anything in common. To know it better, be at the <strong>Rangayana open theater this Sunday any time between 11AM and 1PM</strong> (earlier held in Samvaada vana, Yuvaraja college). (See <a href="http://www.ashwinupadhyaya.com/blog/2010/be-a-wangdu" target="_blank">here for an earlier post</a>). It is amazing to see how 7 Sundays can create many new things or at least ignite new ideas. Here is a list of some of the outcomes from my perspective:</p><!--more-->
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Mysore Chitrasanthe/Kalasanthe - A fixed location in Mysore would host artists of all kinds on a weekly basis. Being a weekly, it has the potential of creating a cultural change. (I had blogged this <a href="http://www.ashwinupadhyaya.com/blog/2010/chitrasanthe-mysore" target="_blank">earlier here</a>).</li>
<li>Startuppers: A sub-network of entrepreneurs/wannabe-entrepreneurs was formed and this has resulted in a great deal of motivation for ourselves.</li>
<li>An Events calendar: Mysore being a tourist destination and a place with daily cultural activities still does not provide updated information on the events to visiting tourists. A weekly product such as this should be of great value to tourists and could be a good sell at the hotels and restaurants of Mysore.</li>
<li>The Mysore Santhe idea itself: Is instrumental in helping many of us meet interesting people whom we otherwise wouldn't have possibly met.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From my experience, not all ideas necessarily succeed. Yet, the higher the number of ideas, higher the chance of at least a few of them succeeding. This is where Mysore Santhe is making the difference. Apart from creating ideas, the other great advantage of such a gathering is the spreading of information. Another list on interesting initiatives here:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><a href="http://www.divyadeepatrust.org/" target="_blank">Divyadeepa Trust</a>: Started in 1992 with a mission of providing value based quality education to rural and underprivileged children. Many of the Santhe enthusiasts are active volunteers at Divyadeepa.</li>
<li><a href="http://mygrapa.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Mysore Grahakara Parishat</a>: I think everyone in Mysore knows about this organization. It is an organization into consumer, civic, environmental activism among others. Some of the Santhe enthusiasts are active volunteers at MGP.</li>
<li>Kukkarahalli nature walk: This is a free walk around Kukkarahalli lake conducted on the first Sunday of every month (7AM) by environmentalists, professional bird-watchers etc. Although I am yet to attend one of these, it seems to me like an interesting walk.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.royalmysorewalks.com/" target="_blank">Royal Mysore Walks</a>: Walk tours in Mysore by Vinay. This week, I am going on an invitational walk with him. I will write more on this after that.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I definitely have missed many more initiatives here which we come across at Mysore Santhe. Every time I have been there, I have found at least one new and innovative idea/initiative at the Santhe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above all, the event is more about the people. If you want to learn from others' experiences and others' mistakes, these are the kind of gatherings you want to be.</p>
