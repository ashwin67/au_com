<p>A few days back, I had been to a school to provide teachers with technical help related to environment related projects. During the discussion, I came to know about some interesting activities being conducted in one of the classes; With a view to teach students about how a seed turns into a plant, they have practical demonstrations and hands-on activities. Similarly, another class did projects based on biogas production. Most of the teachers seemed to be very Eco-conscious. Yet, even the teachers seemed to lack knowledge related to many of the activities. This led to a thought.</p><!--more-->
<p>Why not introduce environment science as a part of main curriculum at schools. At least 1 or 2 hours of this class per week would go a long way in improving the state of our planet. This subject could include theoretical and most importantly practical lessons in rainwater harvesting, biogas generation, energy efficiency etc. Just like every school has a lab, every school could have a tree nursery. Each student could be made responsible for one sapling, from seed to tree in an year. How many crores of trees could be planted in a year!! Also,Â  with renewable energy technologies being taught in practical form, think of the innovation that would result when the children grow up; assuming at least a few would be inspired.</p>
<p>Also, from my past year's experience at Sapgreen, I have seen that children in cities lack respect for saplings or trees. I have seen them vandalize saplings I had planted; for no reason. I can't blame the children for such acts as I have seen that the reason for this behaviour in most cases was ignorance. If the same children had learnt the process of growing a seed into a tree practically, I am sure they would be much more caring for other trees too.</p>
<p>Its just a matter of government policy. One small change in the rule book could change a whole lot of things for the world. For the time being though, I am trying to get one school to make this activity part of its curriculum.</p>
