<p>Strange! I wrote the previous post about writing and since then, haven't written. And then I read this manifesto by Chris Guillebeau: <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/files/2009/04/279days.pdf" target="_blank">279 days to overnight success</a>. If you haven't already read about <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com" target="_blank">Chris</a>, I think you should read now. He is a world traveller and has visited 107 out of  the 197 countries. His goal: To visit every country in the world by April 7, 2013!!</p><!--more-->
<p>I think, the most important points he mentions regarding writing a blog (In fact, applicable to many other activities too) :</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a clear publishing schedule</li>
<li>Create a Compelling Story and Be Remarkable</li>
<li>Clearly Answer the “Reason Why”</li>
</ul>
<p>If a normal person would say the things that are said in this book, I would be slightly skeptical whether it would be possible. But from a person, who has visited 107 countries at the age of 31, it is completely believable.</p>
