<p style="text-align: justify;">Wish you a year of <em>change</em> and a great decade ahead!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replace <em>change</em> with <em>happiness</em>. In my experience, change means happiness. Some of the major changes I did to me in the past 2 years:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Planted more than 500 trees with the help of a lot of well-wishers (and had to stop doing this too!).</li>
<li>Started a business with 2 friends and failed in that (learnt a lot of lessons in the process).</li>
<li>Started another business with same friends and seeing a lot of hope in this (understood the importance of persistence).</li>
<li>Started networking with people (something in which I was really bad at).</li>
<li>Started teaching occasionally at a school to 7th standard kids (learning that education systems really need reforms).</li>
<li>Started blogging.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each one of them has been a life changing experience. Each one of them was a really tough thing to start. Change is always like that. I hope this year would bring more such changes; to me and to you. I'd really want more people to come out of their comfort levels and make a change to themselves and in the process, to the world too.</p>
