<p>The individual is the highest level of decentralization and individual rights are the ones to be protected at all costs but what happens when one's rights are at jeopardy by protecting the rights of another?<br />
Has pro-environmentalism and anti-environmentalism come to this?</p>
<p>The ones who support environmentalism claim that a right to a healthy environment is his right and by polluting the environment, the polluter is actually encroaching on his right. After all, the air didn't belong to the polluter in the first place. So, the polluter has to pay for the mess he is creating so that someone else can clean it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who deny environmentalism claim that the environmentalists are against free trade by vouching for taxes on free air. After all, even the environmentalists use electricity, cars etc and then they cry foul against the same.</p>
<p>Truth is hard to find!!</p>
