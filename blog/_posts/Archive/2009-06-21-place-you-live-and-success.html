<p>Does the place you live in determine your success? I never gave it a thought earlier but now I feel it might be worth thinking. Here's what I think may be missing in a smaller city like Mysore (where I live in):</p><!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Not many entrepreneurs here. The Internet is the only means to meet people.</li>
<li>Limited kinds of businesses here. Its mostly traditional businesses where most people are unwilling to try new things. As a result, low chances to try out new things.</li>
<li>Very very low Internet penetration. So, any online business won't work here, at least as of now.</li>
<li>People don't spend as much as they do in large cities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I may be generalizing on some things here, the fact is that you get less opportunities to explore and less people to interact with in smaller cities. And that exactly is what an entrepreneur needs and that exactly is what I miss these days. I require some action and my city, known as a retired person's paradise doesn't really provide opportunity for action.</p>
