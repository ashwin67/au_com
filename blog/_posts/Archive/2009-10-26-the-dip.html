<p>How does it feel to be Andy Dufresne when he is sentenced to Shawshank? How does it feel to be Chris Gardner when he loses his last bit of money to the government?<br />
I don't know if I can say "I know how it feels to be him". But I sure have seen something close to that! And it is the toughest emotion to overcome. The dip can only be experienced. It cannot be read, it cannot be seen.<br />
