<p>Now, Pink Floyd would have millions of fans. But not everyone would go this far. Not unless it is my friend, Vinay Raghav.<br />
This one would seem to you like some photoshop work. But it is not. Its a pure work of the camera and that is what makes the photo so interesting.<br />

<p>Have a look at this one. I cannot even imagine from where this photo is being taken.<br />

<p>Finally, this one. Now this is something which is straight out of an art exhibition.<br />

@Vinay: I only wish you wrote a blog too with your photos. You'd have a lot more followers. Seriously, man.</p>
