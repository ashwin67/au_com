<p>India is a strange place. One day, its a positive sight. The next, its utter gloom.<br />
The day before yesterday, stocks plummeted so much, they hit the circuit breakers. And today!!<br />
One day, I'm making money like crazy with power stocks. The next day, I don't even have power at home.<br />
They start building an underpass which is to be completed in 3 days. And then the water pipes burst.<br />
Its the same everywhere. I am cruising on Bangalore Mysore highway at well over 100kmph and the next moment, its fumes. My brakes are literally fuming at the sight of an unmarked speed-breaker.<br />
No one ever sees the dark side of the moon. The brighter side is just too beautiful. So, who is going to light up the other side?</p>
