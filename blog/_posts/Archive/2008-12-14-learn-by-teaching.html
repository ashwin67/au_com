<p>I knew this guy who wanted to crack the CAT exams. Instead of taking the usual path of studying books written for CAT, the guy started teaching "how to crack the CAT" to other aspiring students. Of course, the idea paid well. Aspiring guitarists and artists often use this technique. Would Al Gore have such influence and knowledge on the issue of climate change if not for the 1000+ talks he gave on the topic at various parts of the world?</p>
<p>If you want to improve your own knowledge on a subject, work on improving others' knowledge on the subject. It works.</p>
