<p>Many days back, one of my friends commented here on livehournal: &quot;Thats really an amazing job with ultimate satisfaction i guess&quot;. I didn't think much about job satisfaction then. I was thinking more about the resulting trees out of my work. But today her comment makes so much sense.<br />
Today, we at sapgreen planted the first 2 saplings. And by doing this, we may have created &quot;an event to remember&quot; for 2 special people. Read the entire event here:</p>
