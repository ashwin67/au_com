<p>Recently, I had three experiences, however small they may seem had a huge effect on me. First is about entrepreneurs, possibilities and the hope of capitalizing a possibility that brings happiness. Second is about a grassroot approach that can bring immense change. Third is about the necessity to attack common human tendencies with radical approaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>I visited an industry called <a href="http://enlen.in/blog/2009/07/kennametal-energy-efficiency-and-water-conservation/" target="_blank">Kennametal to have a look at the rainwater harvesting and energy efficiency measures</a> they have implemented  over the past 5-6 years. To summarize, I could say: Every drop of rain which falls inside the campus is made to flow into the water table, every possible energy wastage is stopped or in the process of it and the company is saving crores of money every year with the effort. The site visit was attended by many entrepreneurs and people with interest in cleantech. I read a quote sometime back which said "Entrepreneurs do more than anyone thinks possible with less than anyone thinks possible". Here was a great opportunity in energy efficiency sector and here were all these entrepreneurs. Think of the effect. Think of the effect 20 years from now!</li>
<li>Although I always loved planting trees, I never used to get into the grassroot level. Recently, Aditya, a SJCE student and volunteer at Vivekananda youth forum convinced me to <a href="http://www.sapgreen.com/2009/grassroot-work" target="_blank">start tree planting in a different way</a>; No laborers or money involved but instead we do the task ourselves. We dig the pits ourselves, ask the homes around to provide us with decomposable waste, plant the trees, provide thorn protection and water it. Every day, we make it a point to talk to at least two neighbours. I was never so convinced about this kind of grassroot level work until now. The effect has been tremendous. With just 10 days of work, neighbours have started to show interest in the activity. Some of them even want to involve themselves  in the activities. Such concepts of grassroot level work can never be believed unless you do it. Also, the possibilities of such work and the happiness it gives!</li>
<li>I typically have a starting problem in whatever I do. I sometimes used to hesitate to write mails. A few days back, Anil was insisting on me to write a mail to a stranger with some requirement. The same day, I also read a blog by Rashmi Bansal on a concept called <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2009/07/good-day.html" target="_blank">10-10-10</a>. According to the concept, you could take any task and break its outcome on 3 levels. 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. So applying it in my case, writing that mail would cause me a bad feeling for the next 10 minutes (mainly because I was reluctant to write to strangers), would create a good working relationship in the next 10 months (because the person whom I was to write had the same business interest as me) and in 10 years, it may possibly be the best decision I ever made (because, some outcomes can never be predicted). So, I wrote the mail. And yes, first 10 minutes were not good. But I didn't need 10 months for the good things to show up. 10 days was enough!</li>
</ol>
<p>If at least one person gets the real emotion in my mind, my purpose  of writing this is served. Also, do read about Ayyappa Masagi, a grassroot worker in rainwater harvesting who was responsible for the rainwater harvesting methods employed at Kennametal: <a href="http://www.waterliteracy.org/about%20us.htm" target="_blank">http://www.waterliteracy.org/about%20us.htm</a></p>
