<p style="text-align: justify;">In the recent past, I've met many people who have asked me "What made you leave your regular job?". When I left the job, it was only because of some sort of uneasiness and a feeling that it was not right. I never was able to identify the root cause back then.Â  That was 1.5 years back. Now, since the work I do feels so perfectly right, I can identify the exact reason for the discomfort back then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When working for someone else,</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>I could never dream of building an electric car even though I used to work on software for diesel cars. Now I can always dream.</li>
<li>I could never experiment on a technology even though I implemented code for someone else's experiment. Now I experiment often.</li>
<li>I never saw the value of money even though I saw pretty good money. I know now, money is "value".</li>
<li>I could never meet these interesting people with world changing ideas that I meet now.</li>
<li>I never could have been the change I wanted to be.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a sample day. I plant a couple of trees, write a blog, do some technology research, network with business people, prepare presentations, teach about climate change at schools and also play Mafia wars on facebook. This is exactly where I wanted to be. And a regular job was no place for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be a dreamer, to be an experimentalist, to be an explorer, to create change, the only way is coming out of the security net of a regular job. And I'm glad I did it.</p>
