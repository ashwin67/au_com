<p>No.. Thats not my view.<br />
That is the Supreme court's view!!!</p>
<p>Read this:  <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20080806/814/tnl-even-god-can-t-save-this-country-sc.html">http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20080806/814/tnl-even-god-can-t-save-this-country-sc.html</a></p>
<p>And 2 days back, there were more fumes from the court. And that was against the shame of this nation, Karunanidhi. If a court itself is as helpless as to use words such as: "Do you think you are super supreme? Do the Chief Minister and the minister think they are above the law?".. I don't know what the common man is supposed to do!!</p>
