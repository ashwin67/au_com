<p>In spite of doing all that you ever need to do, you would still have this feeling of not accomplished some things. And this causes stress. It is never a good feeling to have unfinished tasks at the desk and go to sleep.</p>
<p>The solution though is extremely simple. You just need some amount of self discipline. Agreed, you can never finish all tasks in a day. However, you can make a list for yourself which tasks you are planning to finish today. Make a realistic time plan for tasks which you want to complete today. Strike off those which you find cannot be completed today. The 15 minutes you use for this will be one of the best investments you have made in the day.</p>
<p>It works. At the end of the day, you can resign to a peaceful sleep.</p>
