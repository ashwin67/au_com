<p style="text-align: center;">Why can't I be there again?</p><!--more-->
<p style="text-align: center;">Where only the sun woke us up,<br />
The peaks showed us the way,<br />
The sight of people cheered us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where life was simple,<br />
There was happiness in the smile of an old man,<br />
There was satisfaction in the face of every traveller.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where the road ahead was always unknown,<br />
The days were always difficult but never impossible,<br />
The goal was never bigger than the journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Or maybe I do not have to go anywhere<br />
Maybe it is not about the place itself.<br />
Isn't this all in the wanderer's mind?</p>
