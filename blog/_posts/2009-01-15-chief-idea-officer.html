<p>Ideas are just a small part when you embark on a big project. As long as you have the ability to think wide, ideas never fail you. However, ideas by themselves do not take you anywhere. Execution is what is required to realize the idea. And execution is what would test an individual to his core. I have seen so many people say "I had plans to do this and plans to do that". Of what use are plans if they are not realized?</p>
<p>If lack of time is an excuse to shelve a plan and not act on it, then the best strategy would be to have a plan which suits one's availability of time. For example, for an office going person to execute an idea, he would have to rely on an idea which could be realized on weekends. A manufacturing type of idea would be very hard to realize if not impossible. A non-real-time online business might be a good idea for this person.</p>
<p>Companies do not have chief idea officers. They only have chief executive officers. That just goes on to show the importance of one over the other.</p>
