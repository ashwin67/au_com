In Europe, there is no reason not to go cycling when the sun shines and the scenery is so beautiful. Lush green fields, forests, rivers and a cycling path laid everywhere.

It also helps that the governments actually care a lot about cycling infrastructure. Dedicated cycling lanes, spaces in trains and even bridges for cycling ensure that cycling is quite safe.

In countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, cycling is not a hobby. It is just a way of life. Rain, snow, sun, wind, nothing stops the cyclist here.

I just wish this were true everywhere in the world.
