[Robot Operating System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System) or ROS is a platform that you can install on linux to quickly do anything robotics related. Advanced navigation techniques, prototyping a robot, visualizing the movement or just learn the various topics involved in a robot; ROS is a platform to do any of that. [Turtlebot](http://www.turtlebot.com/) is a real robot and has probably the highest ROS support of all. So, naturally, buying a turtlebot and having ROS running on your linux machine is the first step towards learning more about robots. So, here is how I went about learning ROS. <!--more-->

- *Prerequisites* 
  <ul style="width: 100%;"> 
    <li>You should be familiar with linux</li>
    <li>Some concepts about IPC and RPC helps</li>
    <li>For turtlebot, you just follow the [manual](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/)</li>
  </ul> 
- Before you buy anything, first get acquainted with the help of [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). It took me a few days to get through this and I still need to refer to it many times.
- Once you have done some simulations and know your way around, buy a turtlebot. I bought the burger. Having anything that moves around is a big motivation factor.
- Assemble the turtlebot by following the [manual](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) and half way through the manual, you have a robot that runs.

Next step is to understand what is happening...
