<p style="text-align: justify;">How was your city 15 years back? Much beautiful than now? I am sure it was. These changes are visible. That is why we cry and shout whenever trees get replaced by roads or when a lake gets converted to an apartment.Â  We care only about the things we can see with our eyes. What about the changes that have happened to our planet? Probably, if eagles were to talk, we would have known. But humans have reached even where eagles fly and we can see the big picture; if we keep our eyes open that is. I am talking about the movie, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/homeproject" target="_blank"><strong>HOME</strong></a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_Arthus-Bertrand" target="_blank">Yann Arthus Bertrand</a>, French photographer, journalist, reporter and environmentalist.</p><!--more-->

<p style="text-align: justify;">The movie shows from an eagle's eye, how humans have changed the face of Earth. You don't have to pay money to watch it. It just costs some time. The movie was distributed free of cost worldwide on June 5th, 2009. Life on Earth is the greatest suvivor of all time. It has survived asteroids, ice ages and it will survive man. The question is whether man can survive in a raging planet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Can we really do something about it? You have to ask for yourselves. I think we can. And there is no point waiting for someone to initiate. If you want to take action, take action today.</p>
