<p><em>A customer is the most important visitor on our premises.<br />
He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him.<br />
He is not an interruption in our work - he is the purpose of it.<br />
We are not doing him a favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us the opportunity to serve him.<br />
- Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
<p>Every discovery seems so obvious once it is discovered. Same goes with thoughts such as above. They seem so obvious once they are said. Aren't they?</p>
