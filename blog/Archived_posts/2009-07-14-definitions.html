<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you want to become when you grow up?</p><!--more-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was 10 years, my reply was simple; Engineer. When you are a child, it always feels good to give the "right" answer. When being "right" means being acceptable by the people around you, the "right" answers are always easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 years later, the reply was a slight modification; Electronics Engineer. At this point, I had told so many people that I'd be an engineer that the pressure to become one was just too much. Also, I was "good" at school. When being "good" means being on the right path to assured money and success, "good" is easy to achieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another 5 years later, a further modification; Software Engineer. At this stage, this seemed to be like the only thing I could ever be. If I was not this, it would seem like I had wasted my life. At least, that is what people told me. It was the "goal" of all the education I had. When "goal" is a constant derived from a few set of parameters, "goal" is the easiest mathematical problem of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The greatest challenge in life is to redefine these simple looking words.</p>
