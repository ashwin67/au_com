<p>First, do read this story: <a href="http://www.zazlamarr.com/blog/?p=240" target="_blank">"I heart Zappos"</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>That is what is meant by exceptional customer service. <a href="http://www.zappos.com/" target="_blank">Zappos</a> in their own words is a service company that happens to sell shoes and handbags and clothing and accessories and eventually anything and everything. The company grew from nothing in 1999 to a $840 million company in 2007!! All of this just by believing that customer service is not <em>one department in the company </em>but customer service is <em>the</em> <em>entire company</em>.</p>
<p>Such an obvious way to grow yet rarely adopted among businesses. Instead of spending 20 - 40% of a company's spending budget on marketing, if it were to spend the same on the customer, wouldn't that make a difference? Zappos is the answer.</p>
