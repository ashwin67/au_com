<p>I'm sure there are hundreds of posts already on how to do this. <a title="Openshift" href="https://www.openshift.com" target="_blank">Openshift</a> has a one click installation as well. It's ok. I'll still write my take on it. The idea is to learn something about how openshift works and how to deploy a simple application on the cloud. A one click install does not provide learning opportunity. However, taking the longer route and doing a few mistakes in the process does exactly that.</p><!--more-->
<p>Let me make it clear, this is not written after I completed the process. Instead, I am yet to start the process. By the time I finish, I should be finished with the porting of my existing blog from a rented server space to openshift cloud. I owe a lot to <a title="Amit shah's blog" href="http://log.amitshah.net/2011/12/blog-moved-to-wordpress-on-openshift/" target="_blank">this blog by amit shah</a> apart from the documentation found on openshift and <a title="StackOverFlow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
<p>And to those who don't know what is openshift, it is just like amazon <a title="AWS" href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS</a>.</p>
<p>What is required before you start?</p>
<ol>
<li>Some knowledge of <a title="GIT" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT</a></li>
<li>A user account in openshift.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you start..</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account in openshift, go to the settings page and create a namespace as well.</li>
<li>Install all the tools that are required for deploying your application (in this case, a wordpress application) into the cloud. Installation of ruby, git and rhc are documented in the <a title="Client tools install" href="https://www.openshift.com/developers/rhc-client-tools-install" target="_blank">following openshift documentation</a>.</li>
<li>I also prefer to have these things done in a linux environment as everything just works out of the box (or rather command line). In windows, I normally have to set a whole lot of environment variables, download <a href="http://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">putty</a> for ssh related stuff and so on. Anyway, it is a personal choice. You could try <a title="Cygwin" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">cygwin</a> though I haven't tried it myself in this particular case.</li>
<li>Once those are installed, it is time to setup SSH keys. This allows you to remotely access your application. On linux, all you have to do is run
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">rhc setup</span></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On windows, you will have to play around with putty first. A detailed explanation is given here: <a title="Openshift remote access" href="https://www.openshift.com/developers/remote-access" target="_blank">Openshift Remote access</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prepare backend...</p>
<ol>
<li>First, type
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>rhc cartridge list</strong></span></li>
<li>This gives a list of all the cartridges that are available for you to create apps. Cartridges are nothing but platforms; ex: php, node.js, python, ruby etc. You will have to use the correct version numbers in the below commands to get things working correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the terminal, just type the following:
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>rhc app create -a <span style="color: #0000ff;">xyz</span>-t php-5.3 </strong></span></span></li>
<li>where  xyz is the name of the application and can be anything. This will take a few seconds and will create an application on the server. Also a copy of the code for your application will be checked out locally into a folder with the same name as your application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, add mysql cartridge to this app using the command:
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">rhc cartridge add mysql-5.1 -a <span style="color: #0000ff;">xyz</span></span></strong></li>
<li>Note down the credentials that are output by the terminal somewhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, add phpmyadmin which is just like the previous step:
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>rhc cartridge add phpmyadmin-4 -a <span style="color: #0000ff;">xyz</span></strong></span></li>
<li>The credentials should be the same as the previous one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now login to the following link: https://<span style="color: #008000;">xyz</span>-<span style="color: #0000ff;">namespace</span>.rhcloud.com/phpmyadmin/ . This is your own phpmyadmin page. Replace the app name and namespace with your own. Create a new user and a database there. The database should have full privileges for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now deploy wordpress...</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the wordpress bundle from <a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress.org</a>. Unzip that file and place the contents of that file into the php folder of your app folder. It should look similar to the <a title="wordpress example from open shift" href="https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example" target="_blank">following example</a>.</li>
<li>Now open wp-config-sample.php file in a text editor and fill in the details there. You should use <a title="Openshift environment variables" href="https://www.openshift.com/page/openshift-environment-variables#Notes" target="_blank">environment variables provided by Openshift</a>to do this. So, the contents would like this:
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">define('DB_NAME', $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']);</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">define('DB_USER', $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME']);</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">define('DB_PASSWORD', $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD']);</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">define('DB_HOST', $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST']);</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also generate the secret keys as described in the</li>
<li>In case of any problems, you could look at the <a title="wordpress 5 minute install" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install" target="_blank">wordpress 5 minute installation help</a>.</li>
<li>Now create/modify the following file: .openshift/action_hooks/deploy and make it look like the following: <a title="Wordpress example deploy" href="https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example/blob/master/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy" target="_blank">Wordpress-example-deploy</a>.</li>
<li>Next, push your repository to openshift:
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">git add --all</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">git commit -a -m "Type some commit message here"</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">git push -u origin master</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's it. Your wordpress blog is now almost ready. In the browser, type &lt;app&gt;-&lt;namespace&gt;.rhcloud.com. Replace &lt;app&gt; and &lt;namespace&gt; with what you have given.</li>
<li>Now, enter all the details that is asked there. Your blog is now ready and you can start adding posts/pages.</li>
<li>If you already have a blog somewhere else, you can now import the contents from there to your new installation using the tools provided in the control panel.</li>
</ol>
<div>Alias and custom domain</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In the wordpress control panel, in the general settings tab, change the wordpress address and site address to your custom domain.</li>
<li>Type the following command so that your custom domain is shown:
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">rhc alias add <span style="color: #0000ff;">xyz</span></span> <del>www.ashwinupadhyaya.com</del></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your custom domain provider's cpanel, you will have to <span style="color: #ff0000;">change the cname so that it points correctly to your &lt;app&gt;-&lt;namespace&gt;.rhcloud.com</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>There are further things to be done in order to gain full functionality. For example, facebook integration, change of uploads directory etc can be done. I'll not cover those here.</p>
<p>And yes, by the time I finished this blog, I am now on openshift.</p>
<p>Total time taken: 6Hrs including time taken to write this blog. So, provided you are familiar with web tools, it is not really hard to setup a blog on the cloud.</p>
