<p>How does a government employee manage to extract bribe from you? Experiences in the past one week have clearly showed me that it is by installing fear. Example this conversation:</p><!--more-->
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Government Employee: "Pay Rs.100"Â  (That is how openly they ask for bribes)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I: "Why?"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Government Employee: "Everyone pays it. You will have to pay it" (Now that is the first trick. Since most people fear acting in a way different to how everyone acts, fear sets in)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I: "If everyone pays, why should I?"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Government Employee: "Well. Don't pay. You will know the consequences later." (The second trick: Direct threatening)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I: "Well, I don't mind the consequence"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Government Employee (To a person sitting next on the adjacent table): "He doesn't know how it works" (A last ditch effort to extract money)</span></p>
<p>My hypothesis for the time being is: "A weak person bribes".</p>
