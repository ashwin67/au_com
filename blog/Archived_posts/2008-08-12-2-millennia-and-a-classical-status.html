<p>The <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ashoka rock edict" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_rock_edict" linkindex="113">Ashoka rock edict</a> found at <a title="Brahmagiri archaeological site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagiri_archaeological_site" linkindex="114">Brahmagiri</a> (dated to 230 BC) has been suggested to contain a word in identifiable Kannada. The earliest examples of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (<i>shilashaasana</i>) containing Brahmi characters with characteristics resembling those of Tamil in <i>Hale Kannada</i> script can be found in the <a title="Halmidi inscription" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halmidi_inscription" linkindex="117" set="yes">Halmidi inscription</a>, dated 450 CE, indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language by this time.<br />

<p>The Languages which saw more than <span style="font-weight: bold;">2 Millennia</span> pass by, are now in a fight for "<span style="font-style: italic;">classical status</span>". What would that status supposedly do? Enrich the language or take language across boundaries like how Purandaradasa or Muthuswami Dikshitar or Thyagaraja did? </p>
<p>Tamil is officially declared as a classical language of India. Kannada and Telugu were about to be accorded the same status. Kaboom!!! A Public Interest Litigation is filed against this. I don't know how any person would find happiness in doing this. <a href="http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=461197&amp;sid=REG">Anyways, this is just more fodder for our KRV guys to disrupt public life.</a></p>
