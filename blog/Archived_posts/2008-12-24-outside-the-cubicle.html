<p>If you don't look out of your cubicle, you are not living on this planet. At least that's something proved by most of my friends who dared to look out of the cubicle. Here is <a href="http://anilalur.blogspot.com/2008/12/ground-realities-cheating-poor.html" target="_blank">Anil's recent experience</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The cubicle life constrains you to only a limited amount of knowledge; The ones coming from the papers, TV and sometimes from other's experiences. In most of these cases, you only get a spiced view of the reality. Thats because no one wants to write plain text or show plain undramatic facts. Probably, even I spice up things sometimes here in my blog. For example, I could have written the first line of this post, 'Only if you come out of the cubicle will you see the reality'. I chose otherwise! Although I just prefer to spice up text, you do come a lot of writeups which spice up the reality itself.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that you need to find a job which doesn't involve sitting in a cubicle. Far from it. I have a few friends who involve themselves in NGOs on a Saturday or a Sunday. One of them had the opportunity to meet Abdul Kalam too! Now, that is something. Just think of all the thoughts the great man would have shared. All I'm suggesting that, you need to atleast occassionally see outside the cubicle too.</p>
