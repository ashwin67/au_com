It's the year when people stopped shaking hands with each other. Most people were scared to be near stangers. A person who coughed or sneezed became a social outcast. Work and home became indistinguishable for many. Many others could not work at all if it involved working with other people. Countries locked down. Airplanes rusted away in their parking lots. Hospitals full. Migrants displaced. Hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths. Economic, social, political crises. And all of this on a global scale. 

The crisis does not affect everyone in the same way. People who can work from home only had to bear minor discomfort for a while. However, there are several people who may not get back their jobs in the foreseeable future. This could cause social unrest in the future.
