Just one year back, I was struggling to find enough time in a day. I wanted to run more, read more books, work on a hobby project etc but always felt that there wasn't enough time in a day. Then, I read the book [Atomic habits about which I blogged last year](/an-atomic-habit). The [book by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) set me on a journey. Whether I should commend the book or myself, I do not know. Because, the results are great. And it can work for you too. Here is a report of my time / habit management story so far.

### How my phone, an enemy of the past is now my friend

I didn't realize before but the phone used up a lot of my time. I thought I was immune because I had quit most social media. But information flows in via news sites, youtube videos, netflix etc and the dopamine effect ensured that I was hooked to the phone without even realizing. Putting time limits didn't help as I would end up getting some other information. The solution that actually worked was to get dopamine out of my own deeds instead of from information.

With the [streaks app](https://streaksapp.com/) on my iphone, I have a set of things to do. Some are daily targets, some are weekly targets and some are monthly targets. I do not intend to finish everything every day so as not to stress out myself. However, every task finished gives a dopamine shot and that keeps me away from spending 6 minutes on youtube. The widget is the first thing I see when I unlock my phone and as a result, everything else has a lower priority.

### How I don't worry about missing a day

Initially, it did feel bad when I missed a day or two of a certain habit. But once the habit became a part of my system, they took control of me and less days were missed. I make use of the technique of habit stacking. For example, I read a book every day along with breakfast. Since I do not miss the former, I rarely miss the latter. Even if I do, I don't care because the overall completion percentage is quite high.

### What about bad habits

Initially, I set targets to decrease screen time. But eventually, I found that the way to decrease bad habits was to fill time with good habits so that bad habits did not get a chance.

### How do the results look

* Learnt Rust, concepts of Deep learning etc
* Running: 4 official half marathons and ~90 Km/month average for the last 6 months of 2022
* Books: 7 books in as many months
* Workout: 67% completion rate
* Learning Dutch: Minimum 20 minutes every day, 66% of the days

### How full is my schedule

It is really counter intuitive but I feel that I still have time left in a day. Once I brought structure into my habits, set systems to manage them and started tracking them, I could see that time was never the problem. And now, the question is not about filling in more things inside the available time but to prioritize what I really want out of a day. Some habits need to go out, not because of lack of time but to increase focus on others. And that will be another post.
