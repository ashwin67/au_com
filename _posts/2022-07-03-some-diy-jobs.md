My robot had become a bit too heavy to carry around. Also, it would trip over if I made quick movements in certain directions. So, I gave it wheels, a support for the arm when at rest and some adjustable legs.

A â‚¬10 transport roller, some adjustable cabinet legs, a few screws, a plank and a few hours with the tools got me what I wanted. A job done plus great satisfaction on a Sunday morning.

Also, I installed laminate and wallpaper. I could have paid someone to do that job and used the time for the robot. But it was no less satisying. Moral of the story is that DIY jobs are always satisfying; no matter if it is high tech or low tech.
