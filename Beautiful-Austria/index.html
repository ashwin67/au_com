In all my journeys through Europe, Austria has been the easiest.</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/hohensalzburg.jpg" alt="HohenSalzburg" title="You just need to look out of the hotel window" /></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.innsbruck.info/en/experience/innsbruck-card.html">24/48-Hour city passes</a> in most cities allow you to enter museums, palaces, special shows, boat rides, local transport and even the cable cars! The €25 for Salzburg city pass’ paid itself after just one cable car journey to the Unterberg mountain. I have bought this card at Salzburg, Vienna and Innsbruck and is totally worth the price. Also, the fact that it is 24 hour and not limited to a certain day means you can plan things better. The only downside is that the shop which sells this normally opens at 9 AM which is a bit late for someone who wants to start their day earlier.</li> <li>Public transportation is extensive, reliable and is well integrated so you do not spend your time thinking which ticket to buy. Contrast to Paris where I would spend half my time thinking if the ticket I validated in a metro would be valid in a bus. Similarly, in the Netherlands, I would be forced to buy a card with an electronic chip (paying extra) even if it was for one or two journeys. Austria though has built almost everything with the tourist in mind.</li> <li>Even as a vegetarian, it is easy to find good food in Austria with so many Indian and Italian restaurants around. There were vegan restaurants too in all the cities I visited.</li> <li>My son was 2 years and 8 months old when we first went to Vienna. You will have to walk a lot and hence a baby stroller is absolutely necessary. The good thing is that the infrastructure is so perfect, I don’t remember folding the stroller and carrying my son anywhere. Elevators, ramps are everywhere and most museums, palaces etc allow you to enter with the stroller.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/austria/unterberg.jpg" alt="May in Salzburg" title="Unterberg, the mountain overlooking Salzburg" /> Just 25 minutes from the Salzburg city center by local bus, a cable car up and you are on the Alps.</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/heilbrunn.jpg" alt="Trick Fountains" title="The funny fountains of a king, well preserved" /> Heilbrunn, Mirabel and Hohensalzburg cannot be missed in a Salzburg itinerary</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/inside_schonbrunn.jpg" alt="Gloriette" title="Vienna tried to compete with Paris" /> The Schonbrunn palace grounds are so large, you need an entire day for this</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/zoo_schonbrunn.jpg" alt="Schonbrunn zoo" title="The royals and their zoos" /> There is also a zoo inside the palace grounds</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/nhm.jpg" alt="Natural History museum" title="All in the name of science" /> This museum is just one among the various museums in Wien</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/wien_danube.jpg" alt="Danube in Wien" title="The longest river of Europe (or is it second?)" /> The Danube grows and grows as it flows towards the black sea. As seen from Donauturm in Wien.</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/wien_parliament.jpg" alt="Wien Parliament" title="Hope the winds don't change" /> Being an Indian, I have visited the Indian parliament 3 times but have never been able to even set foot on its steps (security I understand but I am sad). Here in Vienna, I had snacks sitting on the steps. Strange and sad.</p> <p><img src="/assets/austria/werfen.jpg" alt="Werfen" title="Today, my hotel room looks down upon a once feared castle" /> The lesser known places in Austria are beautiful too. This one is Werfen. Hallstatt is another which I haven’t visited yet.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ashwins-blog.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/Ola-Portugal/">&laquo; Ola Portugal</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/Netherlands-part-01/">Netherlands - Part 1 &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/images/thumbnails/innsbruck.jpg" alt="Beautiful Austria"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/car_charging/">Electric car charging</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;17 Jul 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/social_media_and_the_erosion_of_truth/">Social media and the erosion of truth</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;26 Aug 2020</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/news/">News</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Jun 2020</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <br> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > </div> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@ashwin67"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/ashwin67"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
